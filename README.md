# 👋 Hey, I’m Jamie Whealen

I’m an IT professional with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance, currently working as a Service Desk Analyst and building my path into cybersecurity. I enjoy solving technical problems, automating repetitive tasks, and helping others understand technology — whether it’s through writing, support, or strategy.

I'm building a portfolio to showcase my hands-on skills in **security operations**, **automation**, and **consulting-style problem-solving**. My long-term goal is to become a trusted security professional who can both understand threats and communicate solutions clearly.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- 🔐 Developing automation scripts using PowerShell and Python to support IT and security workflows
- 🧪 Practicing vulnerability discovery and attack simulation through platforms like TryHackMe and DVWA
- 📚 Learning detection engineering and log analysis in my home cybersecurity lab (Wazuh, SIEM, custom rules)
- 📝 Writing security playbooks and advisory guides (ransomware response, Office 365 hardening, etc.)
- 🧰 Building out this GitHub repo as a working portfolio of projects and experiments

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

**Languages & Scripting:**  
- PowerShell (basic to intermediate)
- Python (learning fundamentals, working toward security use cases)
- Bash (basic)

**Security & Monitoring:**  
- Wazuh, Wireshark, CrowdStrike, DVWA, OpenVAS  
- TryHackMe (beginner path), HackTheBox (just starting)

**IT Operations:**

- ServiceNow (ticketing, workflows), Jamf (Mac endpoint management)  
- VMware Workstation Pro, Windows & Linux OS environments

## 📌 Project Areas

This portfolio is a work in progress - I'm actively building out projects in the areas below:

| 🔍 Area | Projects & Ideas |
|--------|------------------|
| **Automation Scripts** | PowerShell for AD cleanup, Python log parsing, Nmap scan wrappers |
| **Security Labs** | TryHackMe writeups, DVWA examples, vulnerable machine analysis |
| **Detection Engineering** | Log analysis techniques, alert rules, advisory reports |
| **Consulting Guides** | Security checklists and hardening docs for cloud and endpoint use cases |
| **Learning Notes** | Markdown notes and lessons from my journey into cybersecurity |

## 🎯 Career Goals

I’m aiming to grow into a cybersecurity role where I can blend **technical expertise** with **advisory skills** — such as a security analyst, consultant, or security engineer. I’m especially interested in threat detection, automation, and helping teams implement secure-by-design practices. I believe clear communication and curiosity are as valuable as technical knowledge.

## 🧠 Outside of Tech

When I’m not studying cybersecurity or building out my home lab, I enjoy writing fiction, golfing, and following UFC. I believe in lifelong learning, creative thinking, and showing up with a good attitude every day.
